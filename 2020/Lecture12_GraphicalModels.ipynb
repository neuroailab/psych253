    "## Graphical causal models and structural equation modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lecture we discussed the mathematics behind structural equation modeling, but skirted discussion of their interpretation.\n",
    "In thie lecture we dicsuss SEM through the lens of graphical causal models. This is a relatively new approach to thinking about SEM; for a detailed description of this approach and its relation to the standard way of conceptualizing SEM, see the 4th edition of Rex Kline's outstanding book, [Principles and practice of structural equation modeling](https://www.guilford.com/books/Principles-and-Practice-of-Structural-Equation-Modeling/Rex-Kline/9781462523344).  The presentation here is built around that book, along with papers from [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) and his colleagues and the excellent introduction by [Glymour, 2006](https://publicifsv.sund.ku.dk/~nk/epiF14/Glymour_DAGs.pdf); I have tried to atttribute all direct quotes but there are some sections that are basically patch-written from those resources, so if you see something here that looks intelligent, please assume that one of those other authors is responsible for it.  Misunderstandings or errors should of course be attributed to me only.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a deep dive into the ideas behind much of this work, I would recommend Pearl's book [Causality (2nd Ed.)](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K)"

Each variable of interest (or *node*) is represented by an ellipse, and the causal relations between the variables are represented as lines with arrows.  The arrows represent the *directed* nature of the graph, and are meant to reflect specific claims about causal influence.  For example, this model says that raining causes the sidewalk to be wet, and that the sidewalk being wet causes it to be slippery.

    "## Causal vs. statistical language\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Correlation is not causation, but it sure is a hint.\" -- Edward Tufte\n",
    "\n",
    "If we see a statistical relationship between two variables X and Y, what does that mean in terms of causality?  It could mean any of a number of different things (Glymour, 2006):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are no causal relations between X and Y; the association arose by random fluctuation\n",
    "2. X causes Y\n",
    "3. Y causes X\n",
    "4. The association is *confounded* - that is, a common third factor causes both X and Y\n",
    "5. The association is *spurious*, due to conditioning on a common effect of X and Y (as we discuss more below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to go from a question about causality to a question that we can assess using statistics, we need to look at the implications of the graphical structure of a causal model on the statistical relations between variables.  In particular, we will focus on *conditional indepdendence*: That is, for which set of variables can we infer that they should be statistically independent, after conditioning on some other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical foundation for the move from causal to statistical langauge lies in the \"calculus of interventions\", also known as the *do-calculus* developed by Pearl and his colleagues.  This approach frames causality in terms of the effects of particular interventions on a graph (such as setting a particular variable to a particular value), allowing one to estimate the effect of such an intervention on the resulting probability distribution of variables.  Importantly, it provides a way to move from mathematical statements about the effects of a particular intervention (\"$do(x)$\") to statements about the probability distributions observed in observational data (i.e. without any experimental control or manipulation). In essence, it provides us with a guide for when we can treat the observation of $X = x$ as equivalent to performing the manipulation $do(X=x)$. We will not go into the details of this foundation in this class; interested readers should consult Pearl's book for a detailed explication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of the graphical causal modeling approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal modeling approach makes several important assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Causal Markov assumption*: Every variable in a DAG is independent of all of its non-descendents, conditional on its parents. That is, any variable X is independent of any other variable Y conditioning on the direct causes of X, unless X is an ancestor of Y.\n",
    "2. *Faithfulness assumption*: The statistical relationships in the data faithfully reflect the causal structure.  In particular, positive and negative causal effects do not perfectly cancel each other out.\n",
    "3. *Negligible randomness*: We assume that any observed statistical relationships did not arise due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d-separation\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that a DAG directly implies a set of statistical independence relations between the variables in the graph.  A criterion known as *d-separation* was proposed by Pearl to allow us to identify these implied conditional independence relationships.  The basic idea is this (from Kline, 2016): A pair of variables X and Y is d-separated by another set of variables Z if and only if Z blocks every path from X to Y.\n",
    "This can happen in one of two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. one of the non-colliders on the path is in Z, or \n",
    "2. there is a collider on the path, but neither the collider nor any of its descendants is in Z\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the three different ways in which a directed graph involving three nodes can be arranged, using different possible causal models of the relation between alcohol use, blood pressure, and heart disease.  \n",

    "This issue arises regularly in observational epidemiological studies.  Let's return to our example of the relation between alcohol consumption and heart disease, via blood pressure.  We interpret this to say that if we could hold blood pressure constant (e.g. using a drug that controlled it), then alcohol consumption and heart diseease would become conditionally independent.  However, it is generally known that people who take supposedly \"healthy\" actions in one domain will often take those actions in other domains as well; this is know as the [\"healthy user bias\"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3077477/). For example, people who drink less for health reasons are also likely to exercise more, which can improve cardiovascular health, either by affecting blood pressure directly or by other mechanisms.  There are also likely to be other factors that affect both healthy user bias and heart disease (e.g. socioeconomic status).  Thus, the true causal graph probably looks more like this:"

    "We saw above that if we condition on a collider (i.e. a common effect), we induce an association between initially independent variables.  Think about the sprinkler example for a moment. If we know that either the sprinkler or rain can cause the sidewalk to be wet, then if we know that it's is wet and that it was raining, then it becomes less likely that the sprinkler caused the wetness; in the langauge of Bayesian reasoning, we have \"explained away\" the wetness once we know that it has rained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Berkson's paradox has important consequences in the context of regression analysis, where including a common effect of the x and y variables as a regressor in the model can introduce spurious relationships.  To see this in action, let's set up a (somewhat contrived) situation that can help us understand how conditioning on a collider (or the child of a collider) can affect regression parameter estimates.  Here we will create a simulated example of conditioning on a collider to see how it affects regression parameters.  "

    "## SEM as a causal model\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas graphical models generally do not make any particular claims about the mathematical structure of the model, SEM is framed in terms of a set of linear models.  That is, graphical models are *nonparametric* whereas SEMs are a particular *parametric* instantiation of those models.  [Pearl (2012)](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r370.pdf) lays out the logic of structural equation modeling (SEM) in the context of graphical causal models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to the model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set $A$ of causal assumptions (justified on scientific grounds) that are encoded in a model $M_A$ expressed as a directed graph.\n",
    "2. A set $Q$ of questions concerning causal relations between the variables in the model --- e.g. \"What is the effect of treatment X on outcome Y?\"\n",
    "3. A set $D$ of data (experimental or observational) presumably generated by a process consistent with assumptions $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs from the process of modeling are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set $A*$ of statements regarding the logical implications of $A$, separate from the data, such as the conditional independences implicated by the graph.\n",
    "2. A set $C$ of data-based claims regarding the magnitudes or likelihoods of the questions in $Q$ given the data $D$ and assumptions $A$.\n",
    "3. A set $T$ of testable statistical implications of $A$, such as the predicted vanishing of particular partial correlations that is implied by conditional independence relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SEM can never provide evidence in favor of the causal assumptions; those serve somewhat like the null hypothesis in standard statistical testing. What it can do is allow us to (sometimes) ask questions out the specific causal effects in the model, and therefore disconfirm particular claims (e.g. by showing that a particular claimed causal effect is not different from zero).  They can also provide us estimates of the magnitude of the causal effect, which could be useful for guiding our behavior (such as treatment or policy intervention).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Bollen and Pearl (2012) say:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Lest there be any doubt:\n",
    "SEM does not aim to establish causal relations from associations alone.\n",
    "Perhaps the best way to make this point clear is to state formally and unambiguously\n",
    "what SEM does aim to establish. SEM is an inference engine that takes in two inputs, qualitative causal assumptions and empirical data, and derives two logical consequences of these inputs: quantitative causal conclusions and statistical measures of fit for the testable implications of the assumptions. Failure to fit the data casts doubt on the strong causal assumptions of zero coefficients or zero covariances and guides the researcher to diagnose, or repair the structural misspecifications. Fitting the data does not “prove” the causal assumptions, but it makes them tentatively more plausible. Any such positive results need to be replicated and to withstand the criticisms of researchers who suggest other models for the same data.\n",

    "## Potential outcomes framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Another prominent approach to causal inference is known as the *potential outcomes* framework, most strongly associated with Donald Rubin. In this framework, causal inference is framed as a missing data problem.  For example, let's say that we want to know whether going to college results in greater income.  For any particular individual, we only have data for the outcome that actually occurred, and not for the counterfactual outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potential outcomes approach has often been framed by its proponents as being somehow in conflict with and superior to the graphical causal modeling approach.  However, Pearl has shown that the two approaches are logically equivalent, such that any statement that can be expressed in one framework can be translated directly into the other.  Thus, one should feel free to take advantage of the framework that seems most suitable to one's particular analyses.  We will not discuss the details of how to implement this framework in this course, as I personally find the potential outcomes framework somewhat unwieldy to think about."

    "## Instrumental variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach in econometrics and epidemiology to assess causal influence is the use of *instrumental variables*.  These are variables that are related to the putative cause, and unrelated to any of the unknown confounding causes (that is, the error).  These are often thought of as \"natural experiments\" in which the instrumental variable provides a manipulation of the putative cause, allowing us to assess its effect on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example where this has been used in epidemiology is *Mendelian randomization*, which takes advantage of the fact that genetic variants are transmitted randomly.  As an example, let's take the case of the ALDH2 variant, in which a particular allele results in an unpleasant \"flush response\" due to the reduced breakdown of aldehyde, and leads to much lower levels of alcohol consumption in people who carry two copies of that allele.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the presence or absence of the particular ALDH2 allele as an instrumental variable.  Let's first look at the causal graph relating alcohol use to blood pressure and heart disease, including unknown confounders that could potentially confound any observed correlation between alcohol use and heart disease:"
