    "## Graphical causal models and structural equation modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "We are starting our discussion of SEM with a discussion of graphical causal models. This is a relatively new approach to thinking about SEM; for a detailed description of this approach and its relation to the standard way of conceptualizing SEM, see the 4th edition of Rex Kline's outstanding book, [Principles and practice of structural equation modeling](https://www.guilford.com/books/Principles-and-Practice-of-Structural-Equation-Modeling/Rex-Kline/9781462523344).  The presentation here is built around that book, along with papers from [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) and his colleagues and the excellent introduction by [Glymour, 2006](https://publicifsv.sund.ku.dk/~nk/epiF14/Glymour_DAGs.pdf); I have tried to atttribute all direct quotes but there are some sections that are basically patch-written from those resources, so if you see something here that looks intelligent, please assume that one of those other authors is responsible for it.  Misunderstandings or errors should of course be attributed to me only.  \n",

    "If you want a deep dive into the ideas behind much of this work, I would recommend Pearl's book [Causality (2nd Ed.)](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/BOOK-2K)"

Each variable of interest (or *node*) is represented by an ellipse, and the causal relations between the variables are represented as lines with arrows.  The arrows represent the *directed* nature of the graph, and are meant to reflect specific claims about causal influence.  For example, this model says that raining causes the sidewalk to be wet, and that the sidewalk being wet causes it to be slippery.  We refer to the cause (the node from which an arrow emerges) as a *parent*, and the node that it connects to as a *child*.  \n",

We can see that the graph in this example implies two possible interventions that one could make in order to affect heart disease. First, we could manipulate the level of dietary saturated fat; for example, we could perform a randomized controlled trial where we randomly assign people to eat either a high- or low-saturated fat diet.  Randomization plays the important role of equating (on average) any other variables that might affect the outcome.  We could also imagine performing a randomed trial where we manipulate cholesterol levels (e.g. through a drug).  In each case, we infer the presence of a causal relation on the basis of our ability to directly control or manipulate a relevant aspect of the system. "

    "\n",
    "If we see a statistical relationship between two variables X and Y, what does that mean in terms of causality?  It could mean any of a number of different things (Glymour, 2006):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are no causal relations between X and Y; the association arose by random fluctuation\n",
    "2. X causes Y\n",
    "3. Y causes X\n",
    "4. The association is *confounded* - that is, a common third factor causes both X and Y\n",
    "5. The association is *spurious*, due to conditioning on a common effect of X and Y (as we discuss more below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to go from a question about causality to a question that we can assess using statistics, we need to look at the implications of the graphical structure of a causal model on the statistical relations between variables.  In particular, we will focus on *conditional indepdendence*: That is, for which set of variables can we infer that they should be statistically independent, after conditioning on some other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions of the graphical causal modeling approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal modeling approach makes several important assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Causal Markov assumption: Every variable in a DAG is independent of all of its non-descendents, conditional on its parents. That is, any variable X is independent of any other variable Y conditioning on the direct causes of X, unless X is an ancestor of Y.\n",
    "2. Faithfulness assumption: The statistical relationships in the data faithfully reflect the causal structure.  In particular, positive and negative causal effects do not perfectly cancel each other out.\n",
    "3. Negligible randomness: We assume that any observed statistical relationships did not arise due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### d-separation\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that a DAG directly implies a set of statistical independence relations between the variables in the graph.  A criterion known as *d-separation* was proposed by Pearl to allow us to identify these implies conditional independence relationships.  The basic idea is this (from Kline, 2016): A pair of variables X and Y is d-separated by another set of variables Z if and only if Z blocks every path from X to Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pair of variables connected by a path in a DAG is d-separated by a set of other variables Z if either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. one of the non-colliders on the path is in Z, or \n",
    "2. there is a collider on the path, but neither the collider nor any of its descendants is in Z\n",

For example, people who eat a \"healthy\" diet will also be more likely to exercise, which can improve cardiovascular health, either by affecting cholesterol directly or by other mechanisms.

    "We saw above that if we condition on a collider (i.e. a common effect), we induce an association between initially independent variables.  Think about the sprinkler example for a moment. If we know that either the sprinkler or rain can cause the sidewalk to be wet, then if we know that it's is wet and that it was raining, then it becomes less likely that the sprinkler caused the wetness; in the langauge of Bayesian reasoning, we have \"explained away\" the wetness once we know that it has rained.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Berkson's paradox has important consequences in the context of regression analysis, where including a common effect of the x and y variables as a regressor in the model can introduce spurious relationships.  To see this in action, let's set up a (somewhat contrived) situation that can help us understand how conditioning on a collider (or the child of a collider) can affect regression parameter estimates.  Here we will create a simulated example of conditioning on a collider to see how it affects regression parameters.  "

    "\n",
    "[Pearl (2012)](https://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r370.pdf) lays out the logic of structural equation modeling (SEM) in the context of graphical causal models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inputs to the model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set $A$ of causal assumptions (justified on scientific grounds) that are encoded in a model $M_A$ expressed as a directed graph.\n",
    "2. A set $Q$ of questions concerning causal relations between the variables in the model --- e.g. \"What is the effect of treatment X on outcome Y?\"\n",
    "3. A set $D$ of data (experimental or observational) presumably generated by a process consistent with assumptions $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outputs from the process of modeling are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A set $A*$ of statements regarding the logical implications of $A$, separate from the data, such as the conditional independences implicated by the graph.\n",
    "2. A set $C$ of data-based claims regarding the magnitudes or likelihoods of the questions in $Q$ given the data $D$ and assumptions $A$.\n",
    "3. A set $T$ of testable statistical implications of $A$, such as the predicted vanishing of particular partial correlations that is implied by conditional independence relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SEM can never provide evidence in favor of the causal assumptions; those serve somewhat like the null hypothesis in standard statistical testing. What it can do is allow us to (sometimes) ask questions out the specific causal effects in the model, and therefore disconfirm particular claims (e.g. by showing that a particular claimed causal effect is not different from zero).  They can also provide us estimates of the magnitude of the causal effect, which could be useful for guiding our behavior (such as treatment or policy intervention).\n",

    "As Bollen and Pearl (2012) say:\n",

    ">Lest there be any doubt:\n",
    "SEM does not aim to establish causal relations from associations alone.\n",
    "Perhaps the best way to make this point clear is to state formally and unambiguously\n",
    "what SEM does aim to establish. SEM is an inference engine that takes in two inputs, qualitative causal assumptions and empirical data, and derives two logical consequences of these inputs: quantitative causal conclusions and statistical measures of fit for the testable implications of the assumptions. Failure to fit the data casts doubt on the strong causal assumptions of zero coefficients or zero covariances and guides the researcher to diagnose, or repair the structural misspecifications. Fitting the data does not “prove” the causal assumptions, but it makes them tentatively more plausible. Any such positive results need to be replicated and to withstand the criticisms of researchers who suggest other models for the same data.\n",
